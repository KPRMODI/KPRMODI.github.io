### Websites I find interesting
[Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/) - I have always enjoyed watching videos on youtube and I find it very interesting of how many vidoes there are. It will never get boring to watch a wide variety of windows that may be either funny or informational.

[Chess](https://www.chess.com/home) - A thousand year old game now online allows millions of people to play and socialize online. I like to play online and hone my chess skills.
